# Simple Chatbot
This project implements a basic chatbot that uses regular expressions (regex) to match user input and respond accordingly. The chatbot recognizes and responds to greetings, farewells, questions, weather queries, and time queries, providing elaborate responses for specific queries and a default response for unknown inputs. The project demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to building a conversational AI, showcasing the power of regex pattern matching in natural languageÂ processing.
